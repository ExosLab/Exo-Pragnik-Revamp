# Exo-Pragnik-Revamp
AH I really should learn how to better use GitHub.

So first of all, copyright Exo's Lab and GregroxMun all rights reserved.
I created these new assets for Pragnik by request of my good friend Gregrox for their excellent mod Whirligig World. 
I was more than excited to have the chance to have my work features in Whirligig World, it's one of the excellent planet packs that inspired me to learn how to make them myself.
Pragnik was a joy to work with, I am of course enthralled with minor planets so I really put my best foot forward into making thie revamp, I think it might be some of my best work yet.
